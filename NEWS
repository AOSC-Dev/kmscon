CHANGES WITH 2:
	* Build scripts were improved and simplified. They also allow much more
	  control about the build process now. The source was split into several
	  different libraries.

	* Added llog.h helper for logging in libraries.

	* Eloop was moved into separate library and supports more more
	  use-cases now. It can be used as a standalone project.

	* Terminal emulator (vte.c) was improved a lot and can run vim now.

	* Console layer was rewritten and is now much faster and much more
	  standards compliant.

	* Uterm monitor was added. The monitor uses udev and systemd-logind to
	  watch the system for new seats and devices. This allows us to run on
	  multiple seats simultaneously and being hotplug-capable.

	* Uterm vt layer was added. This simply wraps the older VT layer so we
	  can switch to different VT systems on-the-fly.

	* New uterm video backends: The fbdev backend is now fully functional
	  kmscon can run on any fbdev device now. Furthermore, the dumb backend
	  was added which is simply an unaccelerated DRM backend that should
	  work even without EGL, GL, gbm, etc.

	* New 2D rendering API. In case OpenGL is not available, we now allow
	  blitting images into the framebuffer. This is used for fbdev and dumb
	  video devices.

	* Font renderer now depends on pango. This is is needed only until I get
	  the time to rewrite the freetype backend. But for now we depend on
	  pango so have full font support.

	* lots of small fixes

CHANGES WITH 1:
	* First kmscon release. For testing purposes only. Includes a rendering
	  pipeline and a very rundimentary terminal emulator.
