= KMSCON =
Kmscon is a simple terminal emulator based on linux kernel mode setting (KMS).
It is an attempt to replace the in-kernel VT implementation with a userspace
console.

== Requirements ==
  Kmscon requires the following software:
    - mesa with:
      - EGL library
      - gbm library
      - GL library
    - pango with:
      - glib
      - cairo
      - pango

== Install ==
  To compile the kmscon binary, use:
    $ make
  There is currently no way to install the binary into your system.

== License ==
  This software is dedicated to the Public Domain. Feel free to modify it to
  your needs.

== FAQ ==
  === Why aren't you using GNU autotools? ===
  Feel free to send me patches. I will apply them immediately.

  === Why didn't you use libvte or similar terminal emulators? ===
  All existing terminal emulators I found highly depend on X. Also, their code
  base often is a horrible mess. I haven't had the time to convert them to use
  other drawing functions than Xlib, yet.
  If you feel like doing this work, please notify me. I would be glad to adjust
  my code to work with other terminal emulators.

  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact one of the developers.

== Code Base ==
  The kmscon code is split into several independent subsystems:
    - output:
      This code manages the KMS/DRI output and provides OpenGL framebuffers.
    - console:
      This draws the text on the screen and provides an API for any terminal
      emulator to visualize its contents.
    - evdev:
      All linux input events are captured here and converted to Unicode
      characters for input handling.
    - vte:
      The terminal emulator library.
    - main:
      This connects all subsystems into a usable console application.
